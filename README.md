# Flip Cards

I am learning to use lesser AI in html css and js revision. With this, I learnt to manipulate DOM(Document Object Model) of HTML document with the use of JS to create cards. I learnt more about box shadows and grids with this project. I also learned to add sounds for events in JavaScript.
